## Description
I wanted to evaluate an mathimatical Expression so I searched to algorithms to do it 
#### The first step that I made in this example:
I converted infix to postfix
Using the stack data structure is the best method for converting an infix expression to a postfix expression. It holds operators until both operands have been processed, and it reverses the order of operators in the postfix expression to match the order of operation.
Postfix has a number of advantages over infix for expressing algebraic formulas. First, any formula can be expressed without parenthesis. Second, it is very convenient for evaluating formulas on computers with stacks. Third, infix operators have precedence.
This is the first version that the infix expression whitout "()" priority
I will make it and update the solution 
## What I learned from solving this
1. I learned about datastructure espasialy,stack.
2. I learned about this algloritm.
3. I learned that I can devided the main problem into small problems to solve it
